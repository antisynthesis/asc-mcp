## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help:

- Document the reasoning behind decisions
- Onboard new team members
- Review decisions when context changes
- Maintain consistency across the codebase

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The circumstances and constraints
- **Decision**: What was decided and why
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and mitigations
